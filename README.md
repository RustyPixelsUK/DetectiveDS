## Introduction

London, 1974. You are a famous Scotland Yard Detective who must solve the murder of the rich aristocrat Angus McFungus, who’s body has been discovered at his home at 427 Park Lane. Arriving at the residence you soon discover that this will not be a simple ‘open and shut’ case, and will take all your finely honed detective skills to solve. Can you put your finger on the killer?

This is a remake of the 1986 C64 game by Sam Monthorpe for the Nintendo DS. Charcters were created by Paul Jay and the plot was cunningly devised by the Magnificent Seven.

## Installation

We recommend the EFS version for most people. For people exeriencing problems with the EFS verison should try the FAT version. This game requires a dldi patch compatible card to play.

- **EFS Version** - Just copy the included DetectiveDS.nds file to your backup card and play.
- **FAT Version** - Copy the Data folder included in the archive to the root of your sd card. Copy the DetectiveDS.nds to anywhere on your card.

The game also runs well under emulation, and we recommend NO$GBA which offers a good compromise between speed, compatibility, and audio, though you will need the NDS BIOS ROMs. We cannot provide these, but Google should find them for you. (The filenames should be BIOSNDS7.ROM and BIOSNDS9.ROM.) Better yet, use NOZ, which is a "wrapper" for NO$GBA which also enables bigger display sizes. Also, setting the 'GBA Mode' in options to 'Poppy Bright' will cure the washed out palette (remember to save options).

DeSmuME is another decent emulator which runs Detective nicely, and which doesn't require the BIOS ROMs.

iDeaS will also run the game under emulation without requiring the ROMs, though audio will be compromised.

(Please note - the emulators will NOT automatically save your progress, due to unavoidable technical issues with DS emulation. However all three offer "save states" which will do the same job - just create a save state from the File menu whenever you're about to quit your play session.)

Remember - nothing beats playing the game on real DS hardware!
